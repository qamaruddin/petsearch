This is a simple asp.net core api project to demonstrate some of the key concepts of de-coupled api development. It searches for pets from two diff api's.

To run the project, simply open the solution in VS and run the project. I  have added nSwag for easier browing and testing of the api.

A location enum could be implemented to check whether the passed in location name is something that is supported.

Unfortunately, I ran out of time.
